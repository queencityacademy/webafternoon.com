For nearly every client, when asked if they have a launch date in mind the answer is always ASAP. What clients do not understand is the cause and effect of ASAP. During this session we will have an open discussion surrounding the following topics:

- How to set client expectations around deadlines
- The cause and effect of missed dates
- The benefits of planning and working in a cushion
- How to become focused on quality not on hours
- Removing the term hours from your vocabulary
- Lessons learned from past experiences
