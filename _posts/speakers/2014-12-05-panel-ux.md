In January, the UX team from American City Business Journals <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Charlotte-User-Experience-Meetup-Group/events/158312402/">pulled the curtain back</a> on what it’s been like to build and maintain a UX department within an existing enterprise. It’s time to check in and see what they managed to accomplish this year, how they adapted to organizational change, and what adjustments they’re making for success in 2015.

<strong>UX Team Management</strong><br />
