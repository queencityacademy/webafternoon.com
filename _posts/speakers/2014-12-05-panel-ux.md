Most of us by now are aware that every business has a slightly different interpretation of UX and often drastically different implementations of user-centered product design. While this can be confusing to newcomers, it’s absolutely necessary for UX to be flexible to respond to each company’s unique business requirements. 

For the past three years, American City Business Journals has been building a UX team to support its online editorial and revenue operations. Like many local UX departments, the ACBJ team is working hard to define its role within an established enterprise. We'd like to provide some transparency into our team and our company so other young UX groups can learn from our successes and challenges. 

We'll talk broadly about team management, pushing for process change, setting vision, and building credibility within our organization. More specifically, we'll dig into several projects that have helped us prove our value to the company: 

1. Designing a CMS for 40+ newsrooms (Hint: It ain't Wordpress); 
2. Taking ownership of front-end development; 
3. Turning a one-star iOS app into a 4.5 star app; 
4. Promoting a more usable and readable article page.
