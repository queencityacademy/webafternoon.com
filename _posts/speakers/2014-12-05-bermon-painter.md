talk-title: Embrace Conflict. Improve Collaboration.
talk-description: Over the years as designers have transitioned from print to the web we've had a reluctant relationship with code. Pixel perfection is a demanding standard. It's required us to get close to the metal and learn HTML and CSS. Some of us have transitioned well and have actually grown to love our curly-braces and semicolons, but it wasn't what we trained for.

One of the largest problems that we face on teams and within organizations is the allusion that communication has taken place. In most cases, when we are faced with the necessity to confront emotionally or politically risky issues we tread lightly in order to avoid hurting feelings. Conflict plays an important and necessary role in the the design process. Healthy conflict increases trust, creates effective dialog and improves collaboration.

During this session we will discuss examples and key skills that will help you:

- argue effectively while maintaining the correct level of candor and respect
- approach difficult issues like dealing with an unrealistic scope/schedule, holding - teammates accountable when they perform poorly, or stakeholders that aren't providing - sufficient leadership for a project
- create successful conflicts that get relevant information in the open
- encourage teammates to effectively share their opinions and articulate theories
