talk-title: "Invisible Visualization: Accessible Information Graphics on the Web"
talk-description: 
---

Data visualizations have become increasingly common on the Web, usually as a way to simplify or draw attention to information in a world where we are bombarded with data. Sometimes, accessibility can suffer, but it doesn’t have to… not when you have SVG and emerging APIs to enhance accessibility.

This presentation will focus on the pragmatic aspects of usability and accessibility, with simple tips you can follow that work in browsers today to make their content available to everyone. Going beyond visual impairment, this talk will cover various areas of accessibility, and delve into the science behind data visualization to show why and how it improves the user experience.

Background information will be mixed with examples, demos, and instructions, as well as pointers to applications and script libraries to make authoring amazing content easy.

Attendees will become familiar with various accessibility considerations, and learn how to use SVG and Canvas to make their data visualizations accessible. They will also learn the basics of the Web Audio API and Web Speech API, and hear about emerging accessibility features of SVG2.
